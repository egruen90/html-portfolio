    <h2>Junior Web Designer/Tour Manager/Videographer</h2>
        <p>With over a decade as a touring musician on international stages, I've cultivated a deep passion for music, refining my skills in performance and fostering connections with diverse audiences. Alongside my musical journey, I bring proficiency as a videographer, skilled in Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut Pro. This dual expertise allows me to capture and edit visually compelling content that enhances the narrative of each project. Furthermore, my enthusiasm for web development, though at an amateur level, reflects a commitment to exploring innovative ways of merging art and technology. This multifaceted background positions me as a versatile and dynamic creative professional ready to contribute to diverse projects.</p>
